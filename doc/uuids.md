# UUIDs in JSON files

All JSON configuration files must contain a [UUID (universally unique identifier)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) to link the on-disk JSON file to the corresponding object in the database. This looks like:

```json
{
    "uuid": "cef0cbf3-6458-4f13-a418-ee4d7e7505dd",
    ...
}
```

To add a UUID to all the JSON files in a course you can run the included `generated_uuids.py` Python script, like this:

```
cd <path_to_PrairieLearn>
cd tools
python generate_uuids.py <path_to_course_directory>
```

For example, `python generate_uuids.py ~/git/pl-tam212`.

This script will add a UUID to the start of every JSON file that doesn't currently have one, so it's safe to run it multiple times. You will then need to commit and push these changes to github.

When you make new questions, assessments, etc, you will need to add a UUID to the the JSON file. These can be generated by https://www.uuidgenerator.net (the UUID version doesn't matter).
