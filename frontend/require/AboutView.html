<h1>About</h1>
<p class="lead">PrairieLearn is an online system for adaptive problem-driven learning.</p>

<h3>Purpose of PrairieLearn</h3>

<p>
  PrairieLearn is designed to help you learn complex material quickly,
  and to give you accurate feedback about how successfully you can
  solve questions. This means that you will know how well prepared you
  are for exams, and you can target your study efforts effectively
  with good knowledge.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
  PrairieLearn uses <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine
  learning algorithms</a> to estimate your ability to get questions
  correct, which is shown as the <em>Mastery score</em>. If you
  get a hard question correct, then PrairieLearn will substantially
  upgrade its estimate of your ability (so you gain a lot of mastery),
  while getting an easy question wrong will cause it to substantially
  downgrade its view of you. This is just like what we do as humans,
  where we are impressed by people doing hard things correctly, but
  disappointed if they do easy things wrong. 
</p>
<p>
  PrairieLearn doesn't have a built-in idea of how “easy” or “hard”
  each question is. Instead, it adapts to your current ability level
  (your mastery score), in a form of <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning">adaptive
  learning</a>. When PrairieLearn has a low opinion of your ability,
  then it will give you lots of mastery points for solving relatively
  simple questions. Later, when it thinks you are better, you will
  have to solve more complex questions to convince PrairieLearn of
  your abilities.
</p>
<p>
  If you do a question several times in a row then PrairieLearn will
  stop paying attention to that question, because it isn't gaining
  much new information about your ability from seeing you do the same
  thing repeatedly. It will start to pay more attention (positive and
  negative) again to a question if you give it a break for a while by
  doing other questions.
</p>

<h3>Strategies for learning</h3>

<p>
  You are free to use PrarieLearn in whatever way you prefer. To help
  guide you, the <em>Recommended</em> ratings for each question
  indicate which questions PrairieLearn thinks are an appropriate
  difficulty for you at your current level of demonstrated skill. Of
  course, it could be wrong about you, and so you are free to choose
  to do easier or harder questions as you like.
</p>
<p>
  The questions are broadly arranged in order in each homework from
  simpler to more complex, so you should expect to generally progress
  through the questions as you study each week's topic. If you want to
  let PrairieLearn choose questions for you, then clicking the “Do a
  recommended question” button will give you questions that should be
  challenging but not impossible for you to do. PrairieLearn
  recommends questions that it thinks you have a roughly 50/50 chance
  of getting correct, and so are the best for learning.
</p>
<p>
  When solving a question, it is best to work symbolically. This means
  that you define variables like $x$ or $v_r$ and work out the
  solution method with the variables, and then only substitute in the
  values at the very end. Although this might seem like more work
  up-front, it is very useful for actually getting the right answer.
</p>
<p>
  PrairieLearn is making its best attempt to assess your mastery of
  each topic, so doing questions incorrectly will reduce its opinion
  of you and decrease your mastery score. This means that guessing is
  a bad idea, and you should not submit answers to questions unless
  you think you know how to do them. This lets you test your <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>. This
  is “knowing about knowing”: do you know when you know how do solve a
  question, and do you know when you don't know? Good metacognition is
  essential for effective learning.
</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
  The PrairieLearn algorithm is very similar to the machine learning
  methods that Netflix and Amazon use to recommend movies and products
  to you, based on your previous watching and purchasing history. The
  only difference is that PrairieLearn is judging your ability to
  solve problems, not your movie preferences.
</p>
<p>
  For each question, PrairieLearn has an <em>item response
  function</em> that encodes the probability you will answer that
  question correctly, as a function of your current ability level. The
  exact model in PrairieLearn is a 4-parameter logistic (4PL) model,
  as used in <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory">item
  response theory</a>.
</p>
<p>
  PrairieLearn doesn't have a fixed idea of your ability, but rather
  has a Gaussian distribution that captures its belief in your
  skill. As you answer questions correctly or incorrectly,
  PrairieLearn uses <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian
  inference</a> to update its belief model for your ability, which is
  then shown as your mastery score.
</p>
<p>
  For any question, even ones you haven't done yet, PrairieLearn can
  use its question response functions and its belief in your ability
  to estimate how hard a question will be for you. This is used to
  generate its recommendations for you, as well as to compute the
  change in mastery that you will get for answering each question
  correctly or incorrectly.
