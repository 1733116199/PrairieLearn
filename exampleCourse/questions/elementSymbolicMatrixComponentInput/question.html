        The symbolic matrix component input is still a work in progress, so this abbreviated example will point out a few things that distinguish it from the "normal" matrix component input. Eventually, the additional examples from the "normal" matrix component input could be readopted here. <strong>[[TODO]]</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Differences from the normal matrix input:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The symbolic matrix input combines the symbolic expression parsing of the symbolic input field with the layout and some of the UI and floating point features of the matrix component input. (The ability to accept floating point is actually different from the normal symbolic input too!)
    </p>
    <p>
    The symbolic matrix input has a <code>show-correct-answer</code> attribute in addition to <code>allow-feedback</code>. So, it's possible to allow inline feedback of partially-credit responses but hide the full correct answer display. Below, the $\mathbf{b}$ matrix input has ths set to <code>false</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other attributes include <code>allow-complex</code> which allows or disallows the $i$ variable to serve as an imaginary unit, as with the individual (legacy) symbolic input element. The <code>variables</code> attribute whitelists variable name strings. Below, we allow <code>variables='x, y'</code>. The <strong>"?"</strong> button on the input element has additional notes about how to correctly enter symbolic expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>[[TODO]]</strong> The <code>relabs</code> and <code>sigfig</code> comparison methods from the original matrix component input are only partially implemented so far. (Note that it's possible to roughly compare some polynomials in sympy by simplifying them and collecting the coefficients; for scalar values themselves, the usual approximate equivalence methods can be used. However, a custom grading script would typically be needed to really check the submission, and the element code in <code>grade</code> in <code>pl-matrix-component-input.py</code> needs to be refactored to allow comparison to be deferred more easily in that case.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with the normal matrix component input, <code>answers-name</code> is what can be used to index into Python objects in the question code. For example, if <code>answers-name='outA'</code>, then:</p>

<markdown>
```python
data["correct_answers"]["outA"] = pl.to_json(A_solution)
```
</markdown>
<p>
where the <code>A_solution</code> variable is a sympy matrix containing the instructor's intended solution.
</p>
<p>
You can also specify placeholder values, input that will appear initially instead of empty fields. These can be accessed through the <code>placeholder</code> param in the code after initializing it, further indexed by <code><em>answers_name</em></code><code>_1</code> ... <code>_99</code>, etc. For example:
</p>
<markdown>
```python
# Initialize placeholder object
data["params"]["placeholder"] = {}
# Add placeholder values, counting from 1, and going across rows:
data["params"]["placeholder"]["outA_1"] = "0"
data["params"]["placeholder"]["outA_2"] = "0"
# ...
data["params"]["placeholder"]["outA_16"] = "0"
data["params"]["placeholder"]["outb_1"] = "0"
# ...```
</markdown>

        Suppose $\mathbf{A}x=\mathbf{b}$ is a linear system. ([[TODO]] Here, no additional checking is actually being done apart from validity of input symbols; see the note above about refactoring the component to facilitate custom grading.)

            The attribute <code>allow-partial-credit="true"</code> is used, so each correct entry receives a partial score.
            By default, when <code>allow-partial-credit="true"</code>, the attribute <code>allow-feedback</code> is also set to <code>true</code>,
            and hence the submission panel indicates which entries are incorrect.
