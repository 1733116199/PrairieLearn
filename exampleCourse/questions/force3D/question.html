  On the diagram below the three red arrows are the coordinate
  axes. The blue plane is the $x$-$y$ plane. The cube has one corner
  at $(0,0,0)\rm\ m$ and another corner at $(4, 4, 4)\rm\
  m$. The tail of the green arrow is at $\vec{r}_A = (4, 0, 4)\rm\
  m$ and it's tip is at $\vec{r}_B$.

  What is the position $\vec{r}_B$ of the tip of the green arrow?

  $\vec{r}_B = $ [<input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.x" />,
  <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.y" />,
