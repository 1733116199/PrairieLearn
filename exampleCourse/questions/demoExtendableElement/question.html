<p>
    This question is a demo of the element extension capabilities in PrairieLearn.  This page has one element on it: <code class="user-output">extendable-element</code>, which loads each extension that it has and renders it to a separate card.  You can see the different functionalities of extensions below.

    Note that no load order is guaranteed for extensions, so the cards below may appear in differing orders on page reload.
