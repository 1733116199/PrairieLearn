Select the correct statements regarding the Newton's law:

<pl-checkbox answers-name='laws'>
<pl-answer correct=true> In an inertial frame of reference, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity,
  unless acted upon by a force.</pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct=false> In an inertial frame of reference, an object remains at rest unless acted upon by a force.</pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct=true> In an inertial frame of reference, the vector sum of the forces $F$ on an object is equal to the mass $m$ of
  that object multiplied by the acceleration $a$ of the object (assuming a constant mass).</pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct=true>When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in
  magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.</pl-answer>
<pl-answer correct=false>When one body exerts a force on a second body,
  the second body will move with positive acceleration away from the first body. </pl-answer>
